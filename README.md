# css-advanced-selectors

This project is a single-page webpage created as part of a class assignment focused on practicing **advanced CSS selectors** instead of using classes or IDs.

The page demonstrates how CSS selectors such as **nth-child, first-child, pseudo-classes, and structural selectors** can be used to style elements based on their position, type, and interaction state.
